1. SJF and FIFO: avg response time = 200, turnaround time = 400

2. SJF and FIFO: avg response time = 133, turnaround time = 333

3. RR with slice 1: avg response time = 1, turnaround time = 466

4. FIFO will produce the same schedule as SJF if jobs arrive in increasing workload 

5. SJF will produce the same response time as RR if for every job, workload = slice

6. It will increase

7. It will increase. The worstcase response time given N jobs and slice T is (0 + T + 2T + ... + (N-1)T) / N = (N-1)T / 2
