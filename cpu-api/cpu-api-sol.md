1. Got the right result.

2. When fork percentage is low, final tree stays small as most processes exit instead of forking. Vice versa

3. Got the right result.

4. Child processes are orphaned and reparented depending on option `-R`

5. 

6. Relation between action list and final tree is not 1-to-1; generally for more complex trees the action list is nondeterministic.
